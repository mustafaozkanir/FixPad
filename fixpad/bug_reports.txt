Description of the Issue
Notepad++ can sort lines using a selected column as the sorting "key". However, if some of the lines are short (have less length than the starting column number of the selection), a crash of N++ will result.

Steps to Reproduce the Issue
Create a new document tab and paste the following:
aaa

bbbbbb

cccccccc

abcabcabcabc
Lines that look empty above ARE truly empty (only contain their line-ending characters)

Make a column block with the start column in any column greater than col 1, for example:

Execute Edit (menu) -> Line Operations -> Sort Lines Lexicographically Ascending

Expected Behavior
I expect Notepad++ not to crash. :)

Actual Behavior
Notepad++ crashes (closes on its own) with the following series of popups before the "closing":
